* Site Location
The application is hosted on the assigned virtual machine (webtech-07) using apache2. It is available to view at: http://webtech-07.napier.ac.uk:5000/. A dotenv file has been placed in the root of the project, as well as various AWS defaults inside the user directory.

* Difference between plan and implementation
Inevitably, Notecast has diverged from its intended, and original, trajectory.

Despite this, Notecast, broadly speaking, fulfills its purpose as a text-to-speech synthesiser and note collation service.
